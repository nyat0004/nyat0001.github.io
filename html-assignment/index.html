        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey! I’m Prince, a creative mind exploring the world of Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. I have a deep passion for design, coding, and all things tech. Born and raised in <abbr title="Burundi">Burundi</abbr>, I speak Kirundi, French, and English. I’m always eager to learn something new, and I enjoy conversations that spark curiosity and creativity.</p>
        
        <p>My interests revolve around web development, multimedia design, and pushing creative boundaries. When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym, learning about new technologies, or just enjoying a good conversation. I believe that growth comes from stepping out of your comfort zone, which is why I’m always experimenting, improving, and leveling up my skills.</p>
